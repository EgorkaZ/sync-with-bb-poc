# Sync test

This is shared part, which should be in sync with alternative repo

The exclusive part is in `exclusive` directory

### Second shared version

Changes in `exclusive` must not be in diff

### Third shared version

There's no change in exclusive part for now

### Fourth version of shared

Please, let something work

### Version five

Once again I want to trigger action

### Sixth version

I want to see the diff file

### Seventh version

Now hope for it working is lost, no modification for exclusive

### Version number eight

It turns out that you have to keep your upstream up-to-date

**TOTHINK**: Maybe we should get diff with upstream branch instead of `push.before`

### Version â„–9

Also with exclusive changes

### Verstion #10

Now we want to have bb-upstream fully synced with master
