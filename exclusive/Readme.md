# Sync test

## Exclusive

This is exclusive part of the repo, which shouldn't be shared with it's alternative

### Second exclusive version

There are also some changes in shared

### Version five

I hope so much for this try, that I even make some exclusive changes

### Sixth version

And I want to be sure it is not contained in the diff

### Version â„–9

Please, don't go to bb-upstream

### Version #10

Even the exclusive part. Idea is that we'll only read and write shared part on Bitbucket side

### 12.0.0 release!

Now I'm starting to think on github actions for PRs
